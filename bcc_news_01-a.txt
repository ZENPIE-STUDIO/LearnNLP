Soaring over the Delhi skyline - at 240 ft - the Qutub Minar is one of the capital's most iconic and stunning monuments. Now a court will decide whether temples demolished centuries ago in the complex surrounding the monument should be restored.

The World Heritage site was built as tower of victory - possibly inspired by Afghan minarets - by Qutbuddin Aibak, the first sultan of Delhi, after defeating the Hindu rulers in 1192. The red-and-buff sandstone monument contains some of the earliest structures of Muslim rule in the country. It was expanded upwards and renovated by three successors - it is now five storeys tall and 379 steps lead to the top.

Historian William Dalrymple noted that the Qutub Minar tower, which looked like a "fully extended telescope placed lens down on a plateau in [Delhi's] Aravalli hills" was a "boastful and triumphant statement of arrival".

The fortified complex housing the minaret has a chequered history. Twenty-seven Hindu and Jain temples located there were demolished and the debris was used to construct Delhi's first mosque at the site. The plinth of one of these temples was retained and expanded to accommodate the mosque, which was itself "built piecemeal", according to a 1926 note on the monument by JA Page, a senior official of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

Members of Hindu organisations carry flags and recite Hanuman Chalisa outside the Qutub Minar demanding to rename the monument as 'Vishnu Stambh' on May 10, 2022 in New Delhi, India.
